1. FErun, based on the first derived function of loss function equal 0, using the first-order proximity attribute
we obtain the embedding by iteration. mainly run RNN.py. 

2. based on proposed alogorithm 1, we obtain the embedding by iteration, using the second-order proximity attribute, mainly run RNN.py.


two ways to get the function embedding
